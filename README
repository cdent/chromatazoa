A simple adaptation of [impress.js](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js)
to get it working with [TiddlySpace](http://tiddlyspace.com/) using the
[tsapp](http://tsapp.tiddlyspace.com/) toolkit.

See it running at http://chromatazoa.tiddlyspace.com/

At the moment it will not work in other spaces without some additional
changes to the `chromatazoa.js` file. The issues are:

* The URL being used to select slides statically selects slides from
  the chromatazoa space.
* The ordering of those slides is controlled by sorting their
  titles.

Slides are:

* Tiddlers with a tag of 'slide'
* They may either be a type which can be rendered, or straight HTML
* Fields are used to control CSS and impress functionality:
  * _class field adds the provided string as class on the slide's
    div
  * _id field sets the id on the slide's div
  * data-* sets the various -x, -y, -rotate, -scale settings as
    described in the impress [soure html](https://github.com/bartaz/impress.js/blob/master/index.html)

As with impress itself, this is not a no effort required solution, but
it could probably be made to be one.
